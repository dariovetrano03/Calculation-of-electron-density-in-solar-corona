# Calculation-of-electron-density-in-solar-corona
This python notebook contains the work of my BSc. Thesis in Aerospace Engineering titled "Electron density profiles variation as validation tool for new high-precision methods to evaluate the center of an occulted Sun".  The input is an image captured from the Metis coronagraph; the output is an electron density polar map of the solar corona.
